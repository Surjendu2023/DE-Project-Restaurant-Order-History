# DE-Project-Restaurant-Order-History

üöÄ Building a Scalable Data Pipeline for Restaurant Order History
Excited to share a recent project where I developed an end-to-end data pipeline to efficiently manage and analyze restaurant order history! Here's how it worked:

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Extraction:
Utilizing Python's requests library, raw restaurant order history data was extracted and landed in the Bronze Layer as the staging area.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Transformation with PySpark:
Using PySpark, the raw data was cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis. It was then loaded into the Silver Layer, ensuring a structured and enriched dataset.
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Azure SQL Integration:
The transformed order history data was further processed with PySpark and loaded into an Azure SQL Database, creating a centralized repository for structured records.
- 4Ô∏è‚É£ KPI-Driven Insights:
Key business metrics were computed, and the final datasets were exported into the Gold Layer in CSV format for consumption by stakeholders.
- 5Ô∏è‚É£ Proactive Monitoring:
Failure notifications were integrated with Microsoft Teams, ensuring real-time alerts and enabling swift issue resolution.
This project emphasized the power of PySpark for handling large-scale transformations and demonstrated how modern tools like Azure and Teams can enhance data workflows.
